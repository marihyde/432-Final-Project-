The original study investigated bacterial community compositions in ticks collected from three locations near Kingston (Lemoine Point, Murphyâ€™s Point, and QUBS) between 2016 and 2018. The dataset includes information on tick state (whole or dissected), sampling segment (whole tick, salivary glands, midgut, and viscera), and genomic sequencing data for bacterial proteins. The goal of our research is to assess the associations between bacterial taxa and LD related bacteria.

Three key biological questions are addressed:

First, we examined the presence of the phylum Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, given the known link between a decrease in Bacteroides spp. and an increase in Blautia spp. with LD incidence. This analysis includes comparing the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, identifying relevant taxa using Supplemental Table S4, and incorporating phylogenetic analysis with NCBI BLAST. We found that Bacteroidetes are more abundant than Firmicutes, which are nearly absent in ticks. Statistical evidence shows their abundances are independent of each other.

Second, we assessed whether amplicon composition for Rickettsial bacteria differs significantly between sampling locations. This involves identifying abundant amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) per site, visualizing the differences using an NMDS plot, and conducting PERMANOVA to test for statistical significance. We found no significant difference in ASV abundance across locations, suggesting factors other than location may be driving differences in microbial composition. 

Third, the study explores additional bacteria that may be commonly associated with Borrelia miyamotoi, and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Correlation coefficients and PCA are used to identify bacterial taxa clustering closely with these LD-associated bacteria. We found there are six bacterial taxa found only in the sole tick that significantly expresses the primary LD-associated pathogen. 

Analytical methods include constructing phylogenetic trees, community structure comparisons, NMDS visualization, PERMANOVA statistical testing, and PCA clustering to uncover patterns in bacterial associations. This research aims to provide insights into the microbiome composition of ticks and its potential role in LD transmission.
